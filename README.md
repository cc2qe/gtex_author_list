#### Generate the file
```
cat gtex_consortium.2016-09.txt | ./format_authors.py > authors_formatted.md
```
#### Notes
I've made only minor modifications to the original Excel document, mostly in scrubbing email addresses, modifying whitespace formatting, and removing building numbers from addresses.
